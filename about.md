Hello peeps, 

I'm a person amazed by technology. It's fascinating we can find mathematical patterns and represent them using technology to achieve a particular purpose. This blog hopes to detail some of that fascination along with some practical tutorials and advice on accomplishing narrowly focused objectives. 

I plan on creating a post once every few months and I hope you find it helpful.
