Hello peeps,

I'm a person amazed by technology. It's fascinating we can find mathematical patterns and represent them using technology to achieve a particular engineering goal. This blog hopes to detail some of that fascination along with some practical tutorials and advice on accomplishing narrowly focused objectives.

I plan on updating this blog whenever I have some spare time!
